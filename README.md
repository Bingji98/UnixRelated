# Bash-completion <a name="bc"></a>
In bash, when using "tab" to complete commands, we may end up only showing different possibilities, but not being able to choose any of them. If you want it to work similarly as it is in zsh, you could execute the next commands:

```bash
bind 'set show-all-if-ambiguous on'
bind 'TAB:menu-complete'
```

If you also want to have autocompletions on commands with a common prefix, and at the same time, valid every time you log in, write the following commands in `.inputrc` and reload it by `bind -f ~/.inputrc`.

```bash
set show-all-if-ambiguous on
TAB:menu-complete
set menu-complete-display-prefix on
set colored-completion-prefix on  # requires bash 4.4+
set colored-stats on  # requires bash 4.4+
set completion-ignore-case on
```

# Bash Prompt and Colors <a name="bpc"></a>

For general settings, please refer to [Bash - Prompt and Colors](https://blog.while-true-do.io/bash-prompt-and-colors/).

# Check current shell <a name="ccs"></a>
There are many different ways to display your current shell [Different Ways to Check Which Shell You are Using](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-ways-to-check-which-shell-you-are-using-on-linux/), and the simplest way is using `readlink /proc/$$/exe`.

# ZSH <a name="zsh"></a>
If you want to switch your shell to zsh, bash, sh, etc., use the command `chsh -s /bin/zsh`. The operation might fail if you don't have the access, and you will end up with `You may not change the shell for 'XXX'`. Then, go ask for root permission. 

Oh My Zsh is a delightful, open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration. It's really a great partner if you want to make your life easier with zsh. You can install oh-my-zsh via the command-line bellow:

```bash
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

However, many times it will report an error: `git clone of oh-my-zsh repo failed`. In this case, you have to install it manually.

```bash
# step 1 
git clone https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh
# step 2 
cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
# step 3 
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

While doing this, another error might be raised: `Peerâ€™s certificate issuer has been marked as not trusted by the user`. This error would come when you try to use git URL with a self-signed certificate. For this, you need to set SSL verify to false in your git config. You can do this in two ways:
```bash
# 1. Set SSL Verify to false only for specific repo:
git config http.sslVerify false

# 2. Set SSL Verify to false Globally:
git config --global http.sslVerify false
```

# Use chsh command <a name="zsh"></a>

```bash
yum install util-linux-user
```
